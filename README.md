<b>Transport-PASS-(PMT) </b><br>
<b>It is a Web-based tool which helps people renewing and registering the bus pass online.</b><br>
<b> PMT</b> pass is an application which is used to generate PMT bus pass. In this,<b> PMT</b> pass project i have developed a software which is helpful to generate & download the <b> PMT</b> pass. Old PMT pass system is manual and it is not computer based process.
Means everyone who want <b> PMT</b> bus pass he have to go into the bus depot and in bus depot he has to wait in the queue for the bus pass. Because there are so many people who want the bus pass.
But in this system we are developing the web based application which is totally user friendly, and using this application no one has to wait in the queue for a long time for the bus pass. There is no need to keep for the manual system for pass because we provide the <b> PMT</b> form pass verification<br><br>

<b>Feasibility Study</b><br>
Preliminary investigation examine project feasibility, the likelihood the system will be useful to the organization. The main objective of the feasibility study is to test the Technical, Operational and Economical feasibility for adding new modules and debugging old running system. All system is feasible if they are unlimited resources and infinite time. There are aspects in the feasibility study portion of the preliminary investigation:<br>
⦁	Technical Feasibility<br>
⦁	Operation Feasibility<br>
⦁	Economical Feasibility<br>


<b>3.1. Technical Feasibility</b><br> 
The technical issue usually raised during the feasibility stage of the investigation includes the following:<br>
⦁	Does the necessary technology exist to do what is suggested?<br>
⦁	Do the proposed equipment have the technical capacity to hold the data required to use the new system?<br>
⦁	Will the proposed system provide adequate response to inquiries, regardless of the number or location of users?<br>
⦁	Can the system be upgraded if developed?<br>
⦁	Are there technical guarantees of accuracy, reliability, ease of access and data security?<br>



Earlier no system existed to cater to the needs of ‘Secure Infrastructure Implementation System’. The current system developed is technically feasible. It is a web based user interface for audit workflow at NIC-CSD. Thus it provides an easy access to the users. The database’s purpose is to create, establish and maintain a workflow among various entities in order to facilitate all concerned users in their various capacities or roles. Permission to the users would be granted based on the roles specified. Therefore, it provides the technical guarantee of accuracy, reliability and security. The software and hard requirements for the development of this project are not many and are already available in-house at NIC or are available as free as open source. The work for the project is done with the current equipment and existing software technology. Necessary bandwidth exists for providing a fast feedback to the users irrespective of the number of users using the system.

<b>3.2. Operational Feasibility</b>
Proposed projects are beneficial only if they can be turned out into information system. That will meet the organization’s operating requirements. Operational feasibility aspects of the project are to be taken as an important part of the project implementation. Some of the important issues raised are to test the operational feasibility of a project includes the following: -<br>
⦁	Is there sufficient support for the management from the users?<br>
⦁	Will the system be used and work properly if it is being developed and implemented?<br>
⦁	Will there be any resistance from the user that will undermine the possible application benefits?<br>


This system is targeted to be in accordance with the above-mentioned issues. Beforehand, the management issues and user requirements have been taken into consideration. So there is no question of resistance from the users that can undermine the possible application benefits.
The well-planned design would ensure the optimal utilization of the computer resources and would help in the improvement of performance status.





<b>3.3. Economic Feasibility</b>
A system can be developed technically and that will be used if installed must still be a good investment for the organization. In the economical feasibility, the development cost in creating the system is evaluated against the ultimate benefit derived from the new systems. Financial benefits must equal or exceed the costs.
The system is economically feasible. It does not require any addition hardware or software. Since the interface for this system is developed using the existing resources and technologies available at NIC, There is nominal expenditure and economical feasibility for certain.
